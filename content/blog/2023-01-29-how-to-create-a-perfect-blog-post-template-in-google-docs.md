### Introduction

The introduction sets the stage for the problem you're about to solve.

You're not providing specific solutions in this section, just why it’s worth resolving. Here, you want to be relatable, getting your readers to nod in agreement.

An introduction like that could apply to any problem, product with a few language tweaks.

**Note:** While your blog will *sometimes* promote your own product or service, it shouldn't exist solely for that reason. First and foremost, the content on your blog should help your readers solve a common problem.

The body explains the solutions to the problem you set up in the introduction.

Now that you've identified a problem for your reader, they're ready to hear your proposed solution.

Your body can be written in paragraphs, with bullets, numbered lists, multiple headings, or a mix. Make use of whichever format is easiest for you.

Each section explains what your product (or, again, service with very minor language tweaks) should have to help the reader meet the goals outlined in your introduction. Then, it reiterates why that's important.
